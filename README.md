# Andralice in Androidland

This is the last course task in Helsinki University's Python Programming MOOC 2003   https://programming-23.mooc.fi/<br>
<br>
The task was to create a game with Python & PyGame and only use the 4 images provided. This task took 10 hours to complete.<br>
<br>
All variable names and comments in the code are in finnish as that was a requirement on the finnish version of the course.<br>
<br>
Description of the game:<br>
<br>
Your task in the game is to collect as many points as possible. You gain more points by climbing higher on the level and and collecting coins.
Coins and ghosts are dropping randomly from the top of the screen. Being in contact with a ghost reduces your points.
Game ends if your points go below 0 or if you fall from a too high place. Additionally you can enter a next level through a door at the top of the map.
On next levels the points gained from the coins are level x 10 points but the rate the ghost reduce your points also grows.<br>
<br>
The platform map is saved on a separate file tasot.txt. The position of the door is set in program code but could also be altered.
